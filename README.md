This project is a Selenium-based automation script designed to interact with the Expedia website to search for flights. The script uses Python with the undetected_chromedriver to navigate the website, select flight options, and perform a sample search from Kolkata to Hyderabad. Key features include:

• Automated Navigation: The script automatically navigates to the flights section and selects relevant flight details such as departure city, destination, and date.

• Dynamic Element Handling: Utilizes WebDriverWait to handle dynamic elements on the webpage, ensuring that the script interacts with elements only when they are ready.

• Screenshot Logging: Takes screenshots at various steps in the process for easy debugging and monitoring.

• Logging: Detailed logging of each step for easier tracking and debugging.


This project can serve as a base for more complex web automation tasks, particularly for booking or searching functionalities on travel websites.
